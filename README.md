creq: An elegant way to generate HTTP/1.x messages in C

## One-line introduction

[creq](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/creq) is a library written in pure C, which allows you to create HTTP/1.x message strings at your own wishes with easy-to-use object-like APIs. With high performance and adjustable memory usage, creq can be used in low-profile MCUs, such as Arduino(AVR) and ESP-series.
